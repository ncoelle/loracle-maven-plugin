based on groupid, e.g. hibernate
loracle could write hints how to resolve license conflicts

just hints, because it is better the end user actually checks

or better return a list of possible licenses
e.g. bsd -> is on of bsd-2-clause, bsd-3-clause ...
     gnu lesser -> lgpl1.0 2.0 2.1 3.0 (and +)
     
     + and with lets this list explode
     
     lets not include with
     

     
in case of urls, just extends the addurl method
